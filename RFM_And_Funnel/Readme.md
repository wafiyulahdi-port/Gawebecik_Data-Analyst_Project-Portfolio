This project implements an end-to-end RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation pipeline for end users using transactional sales data stored in MySQL. The script extracts, cleans, and filters customer purchase data (including return-behavior exclusion), calculates RFM metrics per customer and product, and applies K-Means clustering to classify customers into segments such as Champion, Loyal, Potential Loyal, and Hibernate. After RFM segmentation, the data is further processed to support cohort analysis, enabling customer retention and repeat behavior evaluation over time. The pipeline also enriches the data with a product consumption–based funnel status (Hot, Warm, Cold), computes repeat-order scores, and consolidates all outputs into a final dataset that is automatically uploaded to MySQL as part of an automated ETL workflow with logging and error handling for production use.
