# Gawebecik-Project-Portfolio
This repository provides a high-level overview of the projects I worked on during my time at Gawe Becik (November 2023 – January 2025). It contains summaries of key data analytics and machine learning initiatives, including problem descriptions, methodologies, tools used, and the insights generated.

All information in this repository is presented in a generalized and non-sensitive manner. No proprietary code, internal data, or confidential business details are included. The goal of this repository is to document my professional contributions while maintaining full compliance with company confidentiality.
