# Gawebecik_Data-Analyst_Project-Portfolio
This repository provides a high-level overview of the projects I worked on during my time at Gawe Becik (November 2023 – January 2025). It contains summaries of key data analytics and machine learning initiatives, including problem descriptions, methodologies, tools used, and the insights generated.

All information in this repository is presented in a generalized and non-sensitive manner. No proprietary code, internal data, or confidential business details are included. The goal of this repository is to document my professional contributions while maintaining full compliance with company confidentiality.

## Projects That Cannot Be Shared
In addition to the projects shown here, several major initiatives are not included because they are deeply interconnected and directly tied to core business operations:
* Customer–CS Assignment System
* Customer Membership Lifecycle Analysis
* Market Analysis
* Omset Forecasting Models
These projects rely on:
* Automated data ingestion from the marketing database
* Server-side processing pipelines
* Structured insertion into reporting databases

Their outputs feed sensitive dashboards in Metabase, Looker, and Tableau, all of which contain confidential business metrics that cannot be sanitized or redacted..

## Other Important but Restricted Operational Files
There are also several mid-level operational analytics tasks that are not included for confidentiality reasons, such as:
* Customer chat and call analysis
* Customer address correction workflows
* Attendance record improvements
* Order-related validation processes, including:
   * Duplicate order checking
   * Duplicate customer checking
   * Duplicate invoice checking
   * Duplicate/invalid shipping label checking
   * Return validation
   * Warehouse delivery optimization

These files, while crucial for improving daily operations, remain confidential and therefore are not part of this repository.
